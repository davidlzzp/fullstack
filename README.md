<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>18 5″ corn tortillas</li>
  <li>2 pounds green tomatillos husked and rinsed</li>
  <li>1/2 of a large white onion</li>
  <li>1/2 of a large white onion</li>
  <li>2 serrano or jalapeño chiles</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove</li>
  <li> 3 cilantro sprigs</li>
  <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1/2 cup onion thinly sliced</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cilantro chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup queso fresco</li>
  <li>1/4 cup Mexican cream</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Cut the tortillas into 2-inch, bite-sized pieces, lightly brush with oil, sprinkle salt. Set them on a baking tray and bake in the oven until crispy, about 15 to 20 minutes. Let the pieces cool. Alternately, you can fry the tortilla pieces.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the tomatillos, onions, garlic and serrano chiles in a bowl. Add about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and rub all the ingredients until everything has a light coat of oil. Lay the ingredients in a baking tray. Sprinkle with salt.
Bake until tomatillos are soft and plump and all the ingredients look charred. Let the ingredients cool. Add the charred vegetables, the cilantro and the broth to a blender and mix well.
Heat a pan over medium heat, adding one additional tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the sauce from the blender and finish cooking over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Season to taste.</li>
<li>When the sauce is hot, quickly but carefully add the tortillas. Stir the tortillas into the mixture so that they are fully coated with the sauce.</li>
<li>Serve the tortillas and salsa in a large platter, garnished with the sliced onions, crumbled Mexican queso fresco, drizzle with the cream, garnish with chopped onion and cilantro. Eat immediately.</li>
  </ol>
